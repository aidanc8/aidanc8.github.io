    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <blockquote>My name is Aidan Clarkin, I really enjoy practicing baseball, soccer and martial arts. I learned to code through my summer job in 2019 and create data visualizations with computer programs like Microsoft Excel and Tableau in which I presented data to clients in the summer of 2021. I greatly enjoy exercise and martial arts to relieve stress. I went to Classical High School, a prestigious, college-prepartory school where it is strongly encouraged to take AP Classes and engage in various extracurricular activities. But now I reside at URI where I have a major in Kinesiolgy on the track to become a Physical Therapist. </blockquote>
