    <h2>About Myself</h2>

I come from a white/asian background and greatly enjoy exercise and martial arts to relieve stress. I go to Classical High School, a prestigious, college-prepartory school where it is strongly encouraged to take AP Classes and engage in various extracurricular activities. </blockquote>
